# LearningWebSocket
Learning how to make a simple WebSocket using vanilla javascript for the client and nodeJS for backend.

The client sends a rock paper scissors request to the server and the server responds with his randomly selected rock paper scissors choice.
The client then chooses if you won or lost the game.

The server can also send a rock paper scissors request to the client. The client would then randomly choose his own rock paper scissor choice and decide if he won.

Both games are played in different panes so that the user can see the server and the client interacting in parallel. The client can only control the client side requests by clicking a button.
