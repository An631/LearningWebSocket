# UltimateRockPaperScissorSimulator.
Get ready to be immersed in the ultimate gaming experience with the latest rock paper scissor virtual simulator!!!

Based on the revolutionary web sockete technology this game does the following:

The client sends a rock paper scissors request to the server and the server responds with his randomly selected rock paper scissors choice.
The client then chooses if you won or lost the game.

The server can also send a rock paper scissors request to the client. The client would then randomly choose his own rock paper scissor choice and decide if he won.

Both games are played in different panes so that the user can see the server and the client interacting in parallel. The client can only control the client side requests by clicking a button.

Created to learn how to implement a simple websocket.
Game designed by Angel Duran.
